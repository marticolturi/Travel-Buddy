# Travel-Buddy
Building AI course project

## Summary
Travel Buddy is an app designed to create a network of travelers, making it easier for people to connect with others in their destination area.
The app shows users who else is in the same location, helping them find tips, advice, and companionship during their travels.

## Background
Finding useful information and making connections while traveling can be challenging, especially when visiting unfamiliar places. 
This problem is common among solo travelers or those exploring less-known destinations. 
My personal motivation stems from an experience in Sumbawa, Indonesia, where I struggled to find accommodation, surf instructors, and other travelers to connect with. Travel Buddy aims to:
Save time by providing immediate access to local information and recommendations.
Help travelers connect with others to share experiences and tips.
Make travel more enjoyable and less stressful, particularly for those on tight schedules.

## How is it used?
Travel Buddy is used by downloading the app, selecting the destination area on a map, and viewing other users who are logged in nearby. 
The app uses live location data to show who is currently in the same area, making it easier to connect with others. 
This solution is ideal for solo travelers, people visiting remote or less-known places, or anyone looking to enhance their travel experience by meeting new people.

## Data sources and AI Methods
The app will use live location data from users' devices (longitude and latitude) to determine proximity. It will employ the nearest neighbor AI technique to create a radius for connecting users within specific areas. 
Privacy and consent are crucial, so users must agree to share their location data.

## Challenges
Travel Buddy may face challenges such as:
Overcrowded group chats leading to disorganized conversations and lost information.
Privacy concerns related to live location sharing.
Limited use in pre-trip planning due to reliance on live location data.

## Whats next?
To enhance Travel Buddy, future developments could include:
An "interests" filter to create group chats based on shared hobbies, such as sports, food, or culture.
Options for private chats to maintain organized conversations.
Scalability improvements to handle increasing user numbers and data privacy measures.

## Acknowledgments
Inspiration from personal travel experiences and challenges faced while exploring remote areas.
Data privacy best practices and ethical considerations in app development.
AI technique guidance from the Building AI course materials.
